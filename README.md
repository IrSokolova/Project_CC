While the code generating process, we inserted print right after the variable declarations and assignments for easier debuggind. So you can see how variables change their values.

You can launch the generated .exe file with command "mono <path_to_file>". 

Use command "monodis <path_to_file>" to see the content of the .exe file (Intermediate Language code).
